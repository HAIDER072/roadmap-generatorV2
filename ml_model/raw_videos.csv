wR0jg0eQsZA,Database Tutorial for Beginners,"This database tutorial will help beginners understand the basics of database management systems. We use helpful analogies to explain a high-level overview of spreadsheets, tables, and database management systems. The logic and concepts in this tutorial will make it easier to understand the more technical aspects of database architecture and Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD).

When it comes to organizing data, we often start by compiling everything into a single spreadsheet (or table). But that approach isn't scalable. As more data floods the system, a single table will result in misleading information, duplicate data, and errors.

A better method is to split your data up into smaller tables that have a narrower focus. These tables organize your data in a more efficient way and come together via relationships to form a database. And a database management system is the software that handles the storage, retrieval, and updating of that database.

Database Management Systems are closely related to Entity Relationship Diagrams. If you've spent any time in a database management system, you know that they typically don’t give you the best options for visualizing your database. It’s all in the programming language and it’s hard to see where the connections are. That’s where Entity Relationship Diagrams come in. It’s a visual way of looking at your database structure. Each table translates into an entity. And your columns in each table are listed as attributes in their respective entity. Finally, the programmed connections between your tables are visualized through relationship lines.

Lucidchart is a visual productivity platform that can help you visualize your Database Management System. Our ERD import and export tool make it easy to translate your database into a diagram that helps you spot database errors, find potential improvements, and onboard others to your database.

c5HAwKX-suM,DBMS Full Course for Beginners | Learn Database Management System from Scratch | What is DBMS,"In this video, Shashank Mishra (Data Engineer, Amazon) will walk you through the (A-Z) of DBMS. Through this detailed video, we will be explaining all the concepts related to Database Management System. Learn more about SCALER now: https://bit.ly/3LeGLxV

What is meant by DBMS and what is its utility? 
As the name suggests DBMS or Database Management System is a set of applications or programs that enable users to create and maintain a database. DBMS provides a tool or an interface for performing various operations such as inserting, deleting, updating, etc. into a database. It is software that enables the storage of data more compactly and securely as compared to a file-based system.  A DBMS system helps a user to overcome problems like data inconsistency, data redundancy, etc. in a database and makes it more convenient and organised to use it.

Examples of popular DBMS systems are file systems, XML, Windows Registry, etc.

What is meant by a database?
A database is an organised, consistent, and logical collection of data that can easily be updated, accessed, and managed. Database mostly contains sets of tables or objects (anything created using create command is a database object) which consist of records and fields. A tuple or a row represents a single entry in a table. An attribute or a column represents the basic units of data storage, which contain information about a particular aspect of the table. DBMS extracts data from a database in the form of queries given by the user. 

Who is a data engineer?
A data engineer is one of the data specialists who exemplify the fusion of data science with software engineering. He is the one who works on the building and designing of systems for managing, collecting, storing, and analysing big data at scale. 
Success in this sector is nearly certain, and employers are on the lookout for skilled applicants.

     INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN
o Subqueries (queries within queries)
o Filtering with advanced WHERE clauses (operators, functions)
o GROUP BY clause (aggregating data)
o Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
o HAVING clause (filtering grouped data)

• Data Management: 
o Creating and altering tables
o Data types and constraints
o Working with Views (virtual tables)

h0nxCDiD-zg,SQL Tutorial for Beginners,"In this step-by-step tutorial, learn how you can write your own SQL queries. You don't need any prior knowledge and we're going to use all free tools. By the end of this video, you'll know how to retrieve data from databases. At the end, I'll show you a neat trick to write some of the most complex queries with very little effort.

SQL stands for structured query language. It's a language that you can use to talk to your database. You can also use it to retrieve, filter, sort, combine, add, update, and delete data in a database. It's basically a language you can use to interact with the database. The great thing is that anyone can learn how to write SQL queries. You definitely don't need a degree in computer science. And once you know it, you'll have another superpower that you can use at work.

3JS-XhoGQps,🔥 How To Learn SQL For Beginners | Fastest Way To Learn SQL #Shorts #simplilearn,"In this video on How To Learn SQL For Beginners, we’ll dive into counteroffers. But first, let's recap. In the last video, you shared insights into the role of a data analyst. Yes, I did. In that video, you mentioned SQL. So, how can someone learn SQL? Learning SQL involves understanding the basics of databases and how to interact with them using SQL commands. You can start by learning fundamental concepts such as selecting, inserting, updating, and deleting data. These operations form the backbone of most SQL interactions and provide a solid foundation for more complex tasks. As you progress, you can learn more advanced topics like joining tables, subqueries, and indexing. These advanced concepts allow you to handle more complex queries and optimize database performance.

Can you share some resources to learn SQL? Absolutely. One of the best ways to start learning SQL is through YouTube tutorials. There are numerous channels dedicated to teaching SQL from the ground up, offering both beginner-friendly content and more advanced lessons. Additionally, referring to websites and articles related to SQL can be extremely beneficial. Sites like W3Schools, Codecademy, and Khan Academy provide comprehensive tutorials and interactive exercises that help reinforce learning. These resources often include real-world examples and practical exercises, which are crucial for understanding how SQL is used in professional settings.

Consider enrolling in a good course available in the market. Online platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, and edX offer courses specifically designed to teach SQL, often accompanied by certifications that can enhance your resume. These courses are typically structured in a way that builds knowledge progressively, ensuring you understand the fundamentals before moving on to more advanced topics. By combining video tutorials, interactive exercises, and formal courses, you can develop a strong understanding of SQL and its applications in data analysis and beyond.
