🔍 In this video, we unravel the layers of AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and their applications in tools like #ChatGPT and Google #Bard

We first go through how AI is a broad field of study that encompasses #MachineLearning as a sub-field.

We then break down Machine Learning into supervised and unsupervised models, using real-world examples to illustrate their functions and differences.

We move deeper into Deep Learning: Learn about artificial neural networks and the power of semi-supervised learning in applications like fraud detection in banking.

Then we delve into Generative AI, differentiating it from discriminative models and demonstrating its capabilities in creating new, innovative outputs.

Finally we walk through Large Language Models (LLMs) and uncover the significance of LLMs in AI, their pre-training processes, and their customization for specific industry applications

This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what Machine Learning is, what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, how Machine Learning works with simple examples, and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into self-learning mode without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results.

The below topics are explained in this Machine Learning basics video:
1. What is Machine Learning? ( 00:21 )
2. Types of Machine Learning ( 02:43 )
2. What is Supervised Learning? ( 02:53 )
3. What is Unsupervised Learning? ( 03:46 )
4. What is Reinforcement Learning? ( 04:37 )
5. Machine Learning applications ( 06:25 )

Why learn Python?

Programmers love Python because of how fast and easy it is to use. Python cuts development time in half with its simple to read syntax and easy compilation feature. Debugging your programs is a breeze in Python with its built in debugger. Using Python makes Programmers more productive and their programs ultimately better. Python continues to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations.
Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is free to use, even for the commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license. 
Python has evolved as the most preferred Language for Data Analytics and the increasing search trends on python also indicates that Python is the next ""Big Thing"" and a must for Professionals in the Data Analytics domain.

In this video, we learn about Machine learning in 30 seconds: What is meant by machine learning? Just like a toddler learns that fire is hot by touching it, machine learning helps computers learn from examples. For beginners, if you show a machine many pictures of dogs, it learns to spot dogs. Show it a picture of a cat, and it’ll know it’s not a dog but won't identify it as a cat. This introduction to machine learning helps you understand how machine learning programs work.

If you want to learn tech in just 30 Seconds, don’t forget to follow ""Error Makes Clever.""

I never thought I'd be so captivated by the world of Artificial Intelligence until I stumbled upon this Free Microsoft AI Course For Absolute Beginners! 💎✨ I'm absolutely buzzing to share my journey diving into Microsoft's incredible free AI course for Beginners. 💻🤖


Right from the start, I was hooked! Exploring the basics of AI and uncovering its potential to transform industries had me totally engrossed. 💡🌍 But amidst all the incredible insights, one study truly stood out: the groundbreaking research from Stanford University. They leveraged AI to analyze satellite imagery of regions in Africa, predicting poverty levels with astonishing accuracy! 🛰️📉 Can you imagine the ripple effect this kind of technology could have on our world?


And while this study isn't part of the course, it perfectly showcases the immense power of AI. Speaking of the Free Microsoft AI Course, diving into topics like Natural Language Processing, AI Ethics, and Deep Reinforcement Learning has been an eye-opening experience. 💭🤖 Each module brings new perspectives and challenges, making me even more eager to explore the limitless possibilities of AI. 🌊📚 And did I mention it's totally free? Thank you, Microsoft! 🙌


But enough about me – I want to hear from YOU! Have you explored the world of AI yet? What aspect of this cutting-edge technology fascinates you the most? Drop your thoughts in the comments below and let's geek out together! 🚀💬

ELE2_Mftqoc,Reinforcement Learning Course - Full Machine Learning Tutorial,"Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning that involves taking right action to maximize reward in a particular situation. In this full tutorial course, you will get a solid foundation in reinforcement learning core topics.

The course covers Q learning, SARSA, double Q learning, deep Q learning, and policy gradient methods. These algorithms are employed in a number of environments from the open AI gym, including space invaders, breakout, and others. The deep learning portion uses Tensorflow and PyTorch.

The course begins with more modern algorithms, such as deep q learning and policy gradient methods, and demonstrates the power of reinforcement learning.

Then the course teaches some of the fundamental concepts that power all reinforcement learning algorithms. These are illustrated by coding up some algorithms that predate deep learning, but are still foundational to the cutting edge. These are studied in some of the more traditional environments from the OpenAI gym, like the cart pole problem.
